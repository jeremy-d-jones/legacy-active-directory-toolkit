# Active Directory Toolkit

This is a collection of scripts I've written over the years when I was primarily doing Active Directory work (circa 2015). I gathered these up and ran them through AI to clean up. The basic sytax is there and they look the part but know that I haven't tested these version of these scripts. They're likley out-of-date in more than one way.
